                       <li>Sri Lanka is an island made for tea. Sri Lanka, or Ceylon, as it was known when it was a British colony, is one of the largest tea producers in the world.</li>
                       <li>It’s said that the first tea plant was brought back from China by the British in 1824. It was planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya, Kandy.</li>
                       <li>In 1867, a Scottish man and a huge name in tea, James Taylor, started growing the first commercial crop of tea on the Loolecondera Estate in Kandy.</li>
                       <li>Although the first tea factory in Sri Lanka is no longer in operationAfter a blight of the coffee crops, tea began to take over as the main crop of Sri Lanka, and now around 350 million kg of tea per year are exported by Sri Lanka.</li>
                       <li>Sri Lanka makes some of the best tea in the world, and it’s ranked just behind Chinese tea, Indian tea and Kenyan tea.</li>
                       <li>It’s not just the large tea estates producing tea, there are thousands of smallholders all contributing to the Sri Lankan tea industry.</li>

                   <h3>Hand Plucked</h3>
                   <p>Unlike most tea producing countries in the world, Ceylon Tea still follows the old-fashioned way. With only the choicest leaves of the day one tender unopened bud together with its accompanying twin tea leaves are hand-plucked. </p>
                   <p>Not puckered by a mechanised process that indiscriminately collects the leaves in one fell swoop.</p>

                  <h3>Commitment</h3>
                  <p>From picking to blending, from packaging to marketing, from distribution to sale, over a million of the Lankan workforce that’s approximately 5% of the total population are involved in the process that brings the finest to your cup.</p>
                  <p>Their livelihoods depend on it. Thus their passion and their commitment to brew its continuing success.</p>

                <h3>Ethical</h3>
                  <p>The Ceylon Tea industry is strictly regulated. Its code ensures not only the protection of the soil and environment but also the wealth and welfare of the people who produce it.</p>
                  <p>The growers are ensured with remunerative prices for the tea they produce whilst the labour forces receive a comprehensive package which includes free housing and free health care.</p>
